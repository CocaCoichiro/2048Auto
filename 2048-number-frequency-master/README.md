This was made out of pure curiosity.  I downloaded 2048-hard from GitHub and wanted to see how often each tile of the same value shows up after some number of iterations of running the AI-controlled "auto-run" mode.  By observing the frequency of each number, one can analyze how the AI works for such a game, and in addition, discover if after repeated runs the number of tiles that appear exhibits an asymptotic behavior.  I didn't want to get rid of the animation, so what I did was I made the animation speed up. 

The way this works is you have to click "auto-run," and a dialog box will come up asking for the number of iterations to run.  Once the number of iterations is completed, an array of how many of each number appeared in those runs (including the numbers before running) should come up in the javascript "console."  You should be able to see approximately how many times each value showed up during those iterations.  Enjoy!
